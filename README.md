# About this forked repo

This is an advance version of the tool EclipseSHS released. I have kept most the code the same but removed useless stuff, change the style (OOP) and created a function to grab the interface from the system. This script shouldn't run into errors, if it doesn't support you're system. It will tell you. If you want to request a fix to support your OS (No Windows or Mac). Please report an issue on this repo.
